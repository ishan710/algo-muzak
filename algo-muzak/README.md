In this assignment we'll be experimenting with algorithmic composition using the web's [Web Audio API](https://netart.rocks/notes/web-audio/) (for synthesizing, processing and analyzing audio data). As I explain the intro video for the [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoQrXDiSBWYGQ167CWWvw0AoH-gSVnclm) associated with this assignment, the goal is to create an algorithmic (musical) composition where the same code produces slightly different musical outputs each time it's run (ie. each time we refresh the page).
